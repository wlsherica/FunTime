#note from hadoop first day lecture 
1. What is hadoop?
Framework for running distributed applications on large cluster built of commodity hardware
Data locality, 誰有資料誰做事
Fault-tolerant via replication 預設三份複製
Scalable storage capacity and computing resource
Built-in resource rebalancer

2. Pig, example (hadoop ETL)
schema on-read
不為可查詢語言，是資料流語言，lazy evaluation
You can run Pig in local mode using the command line option -x local. Pig only works with a single filesystem at once.

Book = LOAD 'file.txt' USING TextLoader() AS (lines:chararray);
Wordlist = FOREACH Book GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(lines)) as words;
GoupWords = GROUP Wordlist BY word;
CountGroupWords = FOREACH GroupWords GENERATE group AS word, COUNT(Wordlist) as num_occurence;
WordCountSorted = ORDER CountGroupWords BY $1 DESC;
STORE WordCountSorted INTO 'wordcount' USING PigStorage(',');

Scalar Types:
int
long
float
double
chararray
bytearray

Complex Types:
tuple
bag {(1,2),(2,3)}
map [open#abc]

Pig eats everything:
A = LOAD 'file.txt' AS (var1:chararray, var2:int);

只有在遇到DUMP或是STORE才會執行，底層一樣是mapreduce

傳統RDB都是schema on-write，對於寫入資料庫比較嚴謹

Relational Operattions:
FOREACH = SELECT in SQL
  a = LOAD 'file.txt' AS (id, age, height, weight);
  b = FOREACH a GENERATE id, age;
FILTER
  b = FILTER a by id matches 'a000*';
GROUP
ORDER BY #unstable operation
  c = ORDER a BY age DESC, weight; #一定要放在最後面
DISTINCT
JOIN
  result = JOIN tableA by var1, tableB by var1;
  result2 = FOREACH result GENERATE col1, var1, var2, var3;
